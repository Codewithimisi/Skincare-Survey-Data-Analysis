# Analysis of Skincare Survey Data in Malaysia

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze survey data from Malaysia to understand prevalent skin issues, factors influencing skincare 
product choices, and the potential acceptance of AI-based solutions for skincare management. Through this analysis, we 
will identify common skin problems, purchasing behaviors, and challenges faced by consumers. Additionally, we will assess 
the awareness and willingness to adopt an AI Face Scanner app for personalized skincare routines.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this data collection are:

- To identify common skin problems among people living in malaysia.
